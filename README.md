# disk-usage
Bash script to retrieve /home disk space left

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

copy or move it to "/usr/bin" directory. In order to do that paste the following command in your terminal emulator:

git clone https://github.com/Caiowp/disk-usage.git && sudo cp diskspace /usr/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/diskspace

Now you can type "diskspace" at any time in your terminal to retrieve /home disk space left.
